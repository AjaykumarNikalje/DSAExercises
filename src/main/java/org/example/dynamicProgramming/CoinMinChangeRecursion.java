// Coin Change â€“ Minimum Coins to Make Sum
/*
Incorrect Recursive Condition: The problem is to minimize the number of coins, but your recursive condition is returning 1 when the sum is 0,
which is meant for a "count subsets" type of problem. Instead, it should return 0 when the sum is 0,
because no coins are needed when the sum is already 0.

Inappropriate Base Condition: When n == 0 and the sum is not 0,
it should return Integer.MAX_VALUE (or a large number) to indicate that it's impossible to make the sum with 0 coins.
